<span style="font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;">Citation Network of Finance Journal Articles</span> <em>(2024)</em> 
<a href="https://github.com/parkakn/Citation-Network-Finance-Journals">[Github]</a>
<br>
We built a paper-to-paper citation network of journal articles published in the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) and their citing papers on Google Scholars through a web scrapping program. Our dataset covers 2,373 JFE papers published from January 2005 to February 2004 and 184,568 citing papers from Google Scholars. It contains 410,772 directed edges and node attributes, such as paper authors, publication dates, and sources of publication for citing papers. We further provide information on authors by identifying the university/institute of association and its location.

<span style="font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;">Analysis of Miners in the Bitcoin Blockchain Network</span> <em>(2023)</em> 
<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents?PublicationDocumentID=7981">[Link to Paper]</a>
<br>
As the probability of mining a block and obtaining a reward in the Bitcoin blockchain is proportional to the hashing power spent on mining, miners are incentivized to pool their computing power. Consequently, mining in the Bitcoin blockchain is dominated by mining pools. 

High concentration of mining pool capacity poses a risk to Bitcoin, such as the danger of a 51% attack. However, information individual miners are not commonly available, unlike that of minings pools. Thus, we track the distribution of mining rewards from some of the largest mining pools to the miners to identify individual miners and understand the concentration of the Bitcoin mining capactiy.
